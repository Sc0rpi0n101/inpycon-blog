Auth0 guards over 4.5 billion logins every month, and we couldnâ€™t do it without the help of our community. Which is why we are really happy with being able to not only take part in, but sponsor, PyCon India this year.

We provide a platform to authenticate, authorize, and secure access for applications, devices, and users. Working with everyone from enterprise clients to one-dev teams, we make it easier for devs to build secure access into every application.
