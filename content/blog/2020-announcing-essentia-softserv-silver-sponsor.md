Sponsoring PyCon India is a proud moment for us since the conference was pivotal in bringing the Essentia Team together.

To say the least, our founders met at PyCon India 2012, and the community helped us get discovered by prospective clients with a word-of-mouth marketing.

We also have to mention that we have had the chance to hire and mentor some of the most amazing talents from the PyCon community.

This sponsorship is a small token of showing gratitude and support for nurturing and helping a start-up thrive.

Thank you PyCon India.
