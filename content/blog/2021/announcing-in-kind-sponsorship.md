Summary: Want to give back to the Python community and reach out to more people in the community than ever before? Here's your chance to put your organization in the limelight of the Python community by sponsoring the largest Python conference of this year!


As you all might know that [PyCon India 2021](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) is happening online and we are not taking sponsorship for this year's event and all logistical expenses are being managed through the ticket amount collection itself. Ticket prices are also kept very minimal so that everyone can afford them. However, we are starting with In-kind Sponsorship this year so that Companies/Organizations who are still interested to contribute to the event and add value to the community can come forward and make the most out of this opportunity.

## What are In-Kind Sponsors?

In-kind sponsorship is a type of sponsorship where the sponsor agrees to provide swags (value-in-kind) instead of cash as part of a sponsorship agreement. These benefits/swags would be directly given to PyCon India 2021 attendees. In return for this value add/sponsorship, PyCon India 2021 team would be providing certain benefits to Sponsors, please refer to the Sponsor-Benefits section below. Regarding, what type of swags/benefits can be given to attendees, please refer to the guidelines below.

## What's in it for the sponsors?

This act of goodwill while giving back to the community helps sponsors increase their brand exposure and elevate their business identity within the Python community. Sponsors have a unique opportunity to interact with the PyCon India attendees and get a chance to be represented at the forefront of the biggest Python community in India. The sponsors will additionally be provided with:

* Company logo on the website and PyCon India 2021 program guide.
* One social media post on all official platforms and blog announcement.
* Mention in the opening and closing notes during the conference (18th - 19th Sep)
* Logo display at the end of the talk.
* One email to all registered attendees.
* Sponsors listing on the PyCon India conference platform - Hopin.
* One free ticket to each sponsor.
* Assistance from PyCon India team to send digital swags to attendees.

## Guidelines for Swags/Benefits

With respect to this year's conference being hosted online, we want our prospective sponsors to follow certain rules before deciding on swags for PyCon India 2021 attendees. Please read the guidelines below carefully. 

1. The swag should not be a promotional item, though a valid swag can definitely contain the company's branding.
2. The swag could be digital in nature or tangible item as well but it should be approved by the PyCon India team.
3. The sponsors are allowed to send brochures or promotional content up to a maximum of 6 pages to the attendees alongside the swags they will be sending.
4. If the sponsors are sending tangible swag items then logistics would have to be handled by the sponsors themselves. PyCon India team would provide necessary assistance to the sponsors if any further information is required.
5. Sponsors would be allowed to send swags/goodies to only those attendees who have provided their consent and shared their address for delivery.
6. Digital swags shall be shared with attendees only through PyCon India 2021 official channels. Sponsors need to forward their digital swag to the team beforehand, and the team will be sending the swags to the attendees.

**Please Note: At any point in time, the PyCon India team will not be sharing any attendee-related information or data with the sponsor(s) without the explicit consent provided to the team by the attendees.**
