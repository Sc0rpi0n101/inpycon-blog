Summary: Want to give back to the Python community and have more reach among the community members? Here's your chance to put your organization in the limelight of the Python community by sponsoring the largest Python conference in India.


As you all might know that [PyCon India 2021](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) is happening online and we are not taking sponsorship for this year's event and all logistical expenses are being managed through the ticket amount collection itself. Ticket prices are also kept very minimal so that everyone can afford them. However, we are starting with In-kind Sponsorship this year so that Companies/Organizations who are still interested to contribute to the event and add value to the community can come forward and make the most out of this opportunity.

## What are In-Kind Sponsors?

In-kind sponsorship is a type of sponsorship where the sponsor agrees to provide swags (value-in-kind) instead of cash as part of a sponsorship agreement. These benefits/swags would be directly given to PyCon India 2021 attendees. In return for this value add/sponsorship, PyCon India 2021 team would be providing certain benefits to Sponsors, please refer to the Sponsor-Benefits section below. Regarding, what type of swags/benefits can be given to attendees, please refer to the guidelines below.

## What's in it for the sponsors?

This act of goodwill and giving back to the community can help the sponsors increase their brand exposure and elevate their business identity within the Python community. Sponsors also get to have improved interaction with the PyCon India attendees and the Python community in India. Along with all these benefits, the sponsors also get:

* Logo on the website and program guide
* One social media post and blog announcement
* Mention in opening and closing notes during the conference (18th - 19th Sep)
* Logo Display at the end of the talk
* One email to attendees
* Listing sponsors on Hopin platform
* One free ticket to each Sponsor
* Assistance from PyCon India team to send digital swags to attendees

## Guidelines for Swags/Benefits

Considering it's an online conference we'd want Sponsors to follow certain rules before deciding swags for PyCon India 2021 attendees. Below are these rules -

1. The swag should not be a promotional item, though a valid swag can definitely contain the company's branding
2. The swag could be digital in nature or tangible item as well but it should be approved by the PyCon India Team
3. The sponsors are allowed to send brochures or promotional content up to a maximum of 6 pages to the attendees alongside the Swags they will be sending.
4. If the Sponsors are sending tangible swag items then logistics would have to be handled by the Sponsors themselves. PyCon India team would provide necessary assistance to the sponsors in case any information is required.
5. Sponsors would be allowed to send Swags/Goodies to only those attendees who have provided their consent and shared their address for delivery
6. Digital swags will be shared to PyCon India attendees by PyCon India 2021, Sponsors will have to forward the digital swag data and we'll take care of sending these swags

**_Please Note_ - At any point in time, we'll not be sharing any attendee-related data with the sponsor unless there is explicit consent provided to us by the attendees.**

It is not mandatory that everyone sending a proposal to become an In-kind Sponsor will be selected as a Sponsor. The PyCon India team would like to understand motivation and background and then would take a decision on selecting In-kind Sponsors.
