Summary: Announcing the return of PyCon India as an online conference for 2021.

We hope you've had a safe and healthy year. 

We are very excited to announce that [**PyCon India**](https://in.pycon.org/) is back for the year 2021. The 13th iteration of the mega-conference will be organized online. 

Get ready for four days of non-stop fun and learning with four conference tracks, multiple sessions, BOFs, community booths, workshops, and devsprints.

Accessing the situation with COVID-19 and the rate of vaccination, we have decided to keep PyCon India 2021 as an online event to ensure the safety of everyone involved. We know you all are excited to meet everyone in person and celebrate Python in the "real world", but everyone's health and safety are the utmost priority at this time. 

## Dates

The conference will be held from September 16th to 19th, 2021.

* Conference Days: September 16 and 17
* Workshops: September 18
* Devsprints: September 18 and 19

**Ticket sales will be going live on April 15, 2021.**

**The format for devsprints is still being planned and can be changed anytime before the conference.** 

## Platform

With our amazing experience last year, and great feedback from the attendees, we have decided to use [Hopin](https://hopin.com/) as the platform for the conference again. 

## Call for Proposals

We will be starting our call for proposals soon.  In case you are excited about teaching or talking about Python, no matter whether you started recently or have been using Python for a decade, make sure you put in a talk proposal. No one became an expert in a day - neither at presenting nor at programming. So don't be shy and don't think too much, just put in a proposal.

* CFP Opens: March 01
* CFP Closes: May 15

## Sponsorship and Community Partners

From our experience organizing the conference online last year, we have decided to not take any sponsorships for this year.

On the other hand, we are looking forward to the support from the various Python communities across India in helping us organize, and manage the conference.
